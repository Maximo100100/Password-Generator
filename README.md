# Password Generator

This project was very fun to do and I learned alot by watching other people approach this problem 
on Youtube. I used this one method i saw where someone used the char set for browsers to produce characters
from a random number. After the appropriate checks I put the random functions into an array with a method
i found call .push which added my output to the end of an array, from there I took out random characters from
the array to produce my output. I think this method was better than some I found that simply always put a lowercase
first and upper case in the second character of the password. Instead I added the type (lowercase, uppercase) of character 
in equal amounts and pulled form the array randomly. This way its more random although a limitation of this might be that 
you wont get at least one of all the types characters you choose.
